# Laundry Apps UI React-Native

An UI-Design Laundry Apps crafted using React Native

## Requirements

this apps is currently extended with the following requirements.  
Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Requirement  | Version |
| ------------ | ------- |
| Node JS      | 20.10.0 |
| React        | 18.2.0  |
| React-Native | 0.73.5  |

## Installation

Make sure the requirements above already install on your system.  
Clone the project to your directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/wisnuuakbr/my_laundry_app
$ cd my_laundry_app
```

Install the dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Run the Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
